# Partner Map
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my abilty to use JS APIs and organization libraries. It uses the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/) to show locations using markers and infowindows. It uses the [Vimeo API](https://developer.vimeo.com/api/start) to show videos about those locations from the non-profit [Lahash International](http://lahash.org/) (my wife happens to work at this wonderful organization). In addition, the sidebar is managed by the organizational library [Knockoutjs](http://knockoutjs.com/).

## Installation
No special procedures. Simply clone to your machine and open `index.html`.

## Use
I tried to make it as intuitive as possible. If you hover over an item in the sidebar, it is highlighted on the map and a description appears below. If you click on an item, an infowindow appears containing videos from [Lahash International's Vimeo page](https://vimeo.com/lahash). A drop-down menu in the sidebar allows you to filter the locations in the list-view by country.

## Mobile support
I tried to make it as mobile friendly as possible. When opened on a phone or small tablet, the sidebar is removed but the user can still interact with the location markers and videos.
