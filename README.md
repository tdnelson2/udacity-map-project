# Partner Map
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my abilty to use JS APIs and organization libraries. The [rubic](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/17/view) asks that all DOM updates be handeled by either the Google Maps API or Knockoutjs. It uses the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/) to show locations using markers and infowindows. It uses the [Vimeo API](https://developer.vimeo.com/api/start) to show videos about those locations from the non-profit [Lahash International](http://lahash.org/) (my wife happens to work at this wonderful organization).

## Installation
No special procedures. Simply clone to your machine if you wish to view/edit. In the future, I would like to impliment a build process but I haven't had a chance to do it yet.

## Use
I tried to make it as intuitive as possible. In the sidebar, you can filter the locations by country using the drop-down menu. Click on a location and you will see information about it below. An info window will also appear above the marker on the map.

## Mobile support
I tried to make it as mobile friendly as possible. When opened on a phone or small tablet, the sidebar is hidden by default. When you click on a marker, details about the location appear in an info window above the videos. The sidebar can be reache via the chevron button on the left side. Drop-down menu should function like it does on non-mobile devices except when you click on a list item, it'll close the sidebar and show all the location detail via the info window instead of within the sidebar.
